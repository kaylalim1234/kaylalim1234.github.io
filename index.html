     <h1> Baking Macarons </h1>
    <h4> A personal baking log documenting my experiences </h4>
    <h3><i>A little bit about me:</i></h3>
    <p>I started getting interested in baking during the Covid-19 pandemic, when I was stuck at home. I saw macarons in bakeries and in videos I watched online. With all the spare time I had, I decided to start a new hobby. I heard macarons were difficult to bake, and the challenge made me want to try making them myself. I think baking is a good skill to learn and anyone can have fun doing it, no matter their skill level. Baking is now one of my favorite hobbies! I find myself in the kitchen whenever I need to relax or just want a sweet treat. I can express my creativity through desserts and share my creations for all to enjoy. </p>
