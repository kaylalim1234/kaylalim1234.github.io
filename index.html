     <h1> Baking Macarons </h1>
    <h4> A personal baking log documenting my experiences </h4>
    <h3><i>A little bit about me:</i></h3>
    <p>I started getting interested in baking during the Covid-19 pandemic when I was stuck at home. I saw macarons in bakeries and in videos I watched online. With all the spare time I had, I decided to start a new hobby. I heard macarons were difficult to bake, and the challenge made me want to try making them myself. I think baking is a good skill to learn and anyone can have fun doing it, no matter their skill level. Baking is now one of my favorite hobbies! I find myself in the kitchen whenever I need to relax or just want a sweet treat. I can express my creativity through desserts and share my creations for all to enjoy. </p>
    <h3>What are macarons?</h3>
    <p>Macarons are French cookie sandwiches made with primarily egg whites, almond flour, and sugar. They can have a variety of fillings, but I mostly use buttercream. Macarons usually have vibrant colors and are very delicate. They're different from the traditional cookie because macarons use almond flour instead of all-purpose or whole wheat flour. </p>

    <li>1 1/2 cups (140g) almond flour</li>
    <li>sieve</li>
    <li>3 room temp. egg whites</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla</li>
    <li>food coloring (optional)</li>
    <li>electric mixer (easier than hand mixing)</li>
     </ul> 
    <p>For the buttercream</p>
    <ul>
    <li>1 cup room temp. butter</li>
    <li>3 cups powdered sugar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1-2 tablespoons heavy cream</li>
    <li>piping bag (can use ziploc bag too)</li>
      </ul>
    <p>Instructions:</p>
      <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 320°F</li>
      <li>Sift together the almond flour and powdered sugar into a bowl until there's no clumps then set aside</li>
      <li>Beat egg whites until foamy and add cream of tartar, salt, and gradually add sugar</li>
      <li>When soft peaks form, add vanilla extract and food coloring and keep mixing </li>
      <li>At this point, the meringue should have stiff peaks and stay in the bowl when it's upside down </li>
      <li>Fold the dry ingredients into the meringue (Make sure not to over mix) </li>
      <li>Pipe mixture onto a baking sheet and release air bubbles by tapping the tray</li>
      <li>Let the tray rest for about 30 min-1 hour to let the skin on top form</li>
      <li>Bake for 15 min</li>
      <li>While the macarons are baking, make the buttercream by mixing butter, powdered sugar, vanilla extract, and heavy cream</li>
      <li>Mix the buttercream until you get your desired consistency</li>
      <li>After macarons are out of the oven, let them completely cool</li>
      <li>Pipe buttercream on one shell then place another shell on top like a sandwich</li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
